	<div class="post-intro">My name is Vincent Lesierse. I'm a software architect and technology enthousiast with my head in the cloud and love to code.</div>
		<p>I started out with a pasion for software engineering, but grew over years into the cloud where I love the challenges of scale and the dynamics of running software for a large set of users. I like to cover the full stack of the application. Think about composing the UI and allow the customer to have the best experience possible, communicate in a resilient and same maner or make sure the data is stored and retrieved efficiently.</p>
		<p>Most of my time I've designed and developed framework components using .NET, but I've written applications on various stacks. As fun that it is, I like to be practical as well to bring value for the customer. As a developer and architect I believe you should continuously broaden your horizon and try out various technologies, patterns and practices.</p>
